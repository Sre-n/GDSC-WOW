### The Project

We connect citizens and artists to call upon social leaders, corporate lesders and philanthropists to do their part.
This is our generationâ€™s moment and it is in our hands.


Our voices inspire action to DEMAND Equity, PROMOTE Infrastructure and
Difference-Making Technologies and UPHOLD Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.
We post, tweet, message, vote, sign, and call influential leaders and citizens to act. The
collective actions of our community can make a difference to end disparity now.We are a community open to anyone who believes 
that their voice can bring a positive change in the society


For us art is anything done and raised with passion including fiery petitions,
unconventional book review columns, blogs, music, paintings, videos,short films, tweets and
random literature. We give you the stage to raise your voice.
Join in for our bohemian revolution!
